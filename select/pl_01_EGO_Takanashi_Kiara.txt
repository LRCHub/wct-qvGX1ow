I’m way too cool for this
I do my thing, no rules for this
I get that bag it’s lucrative
You curious?
Look closer
It’s so obvious
How I can make a scene
Jump with my energy
I’ll make you scream it loud, loud, loud
(Hit it)
Serve it up
On a platter, leave no crumbs
Ate it up
(That’s just my ego)
It’s your attention that I crave on the stage
I feel it pumping through my veins
Comin’ at you right now
Ooh ~
It’s my, it’s my, it’s my
Ego, go, go
Living for your applause
I’ll dance on either way
XOXO EGO
Fueling up my fantasy, I’m breaking through
It’s just my ego
Oh
I’m doing what they thought I couldn’t do
XOXO EGO
The rise and fall
Of a popstar
Yuh
I’m on a ego trip
No mirage, all real, it ain’t no trick
I don’t hold my tongue I know I’m it
I’m your favorites favorite, I’m that bitch
Tabloids say
I’m conceited and they’re right
Ain’t no shame
Either way they’re gonna write
“She’s so explicit”
But stay in my mentions, huh?
Got your attention
Baby, that’s show business
Ooh ~
It’s my, it’s my, it’s my
Ego, go, go
Living for your applause
I’ll dance on either way
XOXO EGO
Fueling up my fantasy, I’m breaking through
It’s just my ego
Oh
I’m doing what they thought I couldn’t do
XOXO EGO
EGO
They say I’m a show off
EGO
XOXO EGO
EGO
Don’t like it? Tough luck
EGO
XOXO EGO
(Ego)
(Ego)
(Ego)
(Ego)
That’s just my ego
XOXO
